            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The course <em>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</em> has been a fascinating exploration into solving problems efficiently and systematically. What made it especially engaging was how we started with relatable, real-world scenarios. For instance, we tackled a "letter and envelopes" problem: the task of personally visiting friends to invite them to an event. Each friend’s location was marked on a map, and we had to figure out the shortest path to meet everyone in the least amount of time. This hands-on approach set the foundation for understanding key concepts like <em>Dijkstra’s algorithm</em>, which finds the shortest paths in graphs, and <strong>BFS/DFS</strong>, which are essential techniques for exploring connected networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we progressed, we delved into various <em>data structures</em>, such as <strong>AVL trees, Red-Black trees, 2-3 trees, and generic binary trees</strong>, learning how they enable efficient data organization, search, and updates. These structures are fundamental in applications like databases, file systems, and search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also studied advanced algorithms, including <em>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)</em> and <em>Rabin-Karp</em>, which are used for efficient string pattern matching. These algorithms have wide applications, from text searching in documents to DNA sequence analysis. Along the way, we also explored classic graph and optimization techniques, like <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong>, <em>minimum spanning tree algorithms</em>, and even strategies for handling complex tasks like scheduling and resource allocation.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most exciting aspects of the course was connecting these algorithms and data structures to <em>real-world applications</em>. From <strong>network routing</strong> (finding optimal paths in communication systems) to <em>logistics optimization</em> (minimizing delivery routes) and even <em>AI-related search problems</em>, the practical value of what we learned was constantly evident. We also explored how penalty-based systems and heuristics, inspired by real scenarios, can influence algorithm design.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, this course wasn’t just about algorithms and data structures—it was about building a problem-solving mindset. It taught us how to think critically, approach problems creatively, and design solutions that are both efficient and effective in the real world.
